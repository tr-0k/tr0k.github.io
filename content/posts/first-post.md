Hey! My pleasure to meet you. Take a seat. Grab a beer, light a cig, make yourself a home.

This is how certain posts I've been reading in the past few months made me feel.
Casually scrolling the hackernews lead me to the lots of interesting blogs.
People are writing about various topics. From tech related stuff, to sociology,
life experiences, challenges they're facing at the time etc.

From all these articles I was able to learn a lot just by reading a few in the morning
while enjoying my coffee before jumping into the task I've been assigned with.

Since I like to play around with lots of things and am constantly seeking a way
of getting in touch with the people of the same interests, I decided to start my own blog.

The idea is to get back to some small projects I've started long time ago, actually finish them
and write about the process. Also, I may say a word or two about the security, music, software engineering
and whatever pops up my mind at that time.

At some point, I plan on enabling comments so you guys can also share your thoughts and make this a better place.

Have a very nice fucking day!
