# Been tryin' to meet you
Exactly, that's the great mission everybody's talking about. 
Exploring the boundaries, finding the weak spots, enjoying the moment,
being yourself, aaahhh....
Approaches are different, some are more suitable than the others but it really
doesn't matter if it gets you to the point.

Idea of writting about the things you're passionate about sparked my mind.
Lots of stuff is waiting for each one of us. It's out there.
Some things need to get done, some are just sitting there as a reminder of
who we were, who we are and the new experiences are the ones that will shape
our future self.

Running my own blog is something that was on my todo list for a long time. 
Finally, I have found the right setup.

# Ummm, content???
Mostly, I will write about the projects I am trying to work on in my spare time.
A word or two might be said about security, architecture and software engineering.

This is the current concept, can't wait to see where this experience is going
to take me. 

At some point, comment section will be enabled so you'll get a chance to rant
about the stuff I write.

### So long, and thanks for all the fish!
