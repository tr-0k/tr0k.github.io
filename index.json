Exploring the boundaries, finding the weak spots, enjoying the moment, being yourself, aaahhh\u0026hellip;. Approaches are different, some are more suitable than the others but it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if it gets you to the point.\nIdea of writting about the things you\u0026rsquo;re passionate about sparked my mind. Lots of stuff is waiting for each one of us. It\u0026rsquo;s out there. Some things need to get done, some are just sitting there as a reminder of who we were, who we are and the new experiences are the ones that will shape our future self.\nRunning my own blog is something that was on my todo list for a long time. Finally, I have found the right setup.\nUmmm, content??? # Mostly, I will write about the projects I am trying to work on in my spare time. A word or two might be said about security, architecture and software engineering.\nThis is the current concept, can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see where this experience is going to take me.\nAt some point, comment section will be enabled so you\u0026rsquo;ll get a chance to rant about the stuff I write.\nSo long, and thanks for all the fish! # ","date":"29 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/intro/","section":"Posts","summary":"Please allow me to introduce myself I am man of wealth and taste\u0026hellip;","title":"Hey!","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 November 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
